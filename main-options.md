# Menu Options

One of the main additions to the **Lagomier** theme is the navigation which is available on desktop (in the sidebar) and mobile (as a tab bar).  The original [Lagom][lagom] only provided the home link as well as a home icon link on each post page.  I felt that it was important to provide more options.

This isn't a perfect implementation, as it currently only works well (looks good on mobile) with three to four menu items.  On mobile there is a more (ellipsis) added to the end which is used to display the sidebar.

## Configuration

The menu options are customizable using a `menu-options` collection within the `_config.yml` file.
